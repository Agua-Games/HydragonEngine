# Hydragon Engine

Hydragon - versatile solution for entertainment studios and individuals. Designed to empower small studios and one-man teams, boost their productivity to new levels with high quality results.

*NOTE:
As of January 2025 the codebase is still udergoing first-phase sketching and maintenance, code cleanup - that was part of our initial approach, as weird as it may seem at first.
So be aware that you won't succeed if you try to compile the engine now as it is.
